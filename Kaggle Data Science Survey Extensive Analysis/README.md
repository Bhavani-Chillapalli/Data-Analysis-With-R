## Overview
Welcome to Kaggle's second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey ― and our first-ever survey data challenge.

This year, as last year, we set out to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data 
science and machine learning. The survey was live for one week in October, and after cleaning the data we finished with 23,859 responses, 
a 49% increase over last year!

There's a lot to explore here. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in 
different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field. We've published the data in as raw a format as 
possible without compromising anonymization, which makes it an unusual example of a survey dataset.

## Survey Methodology

This survey received 23,859 usable respondents from 147 countries and territories. If a country or territory received less than 50 
respondents, we grouped them into a group named “Other” for anonymity.

We excluded respondents who were flagged by our survey system as “Spam”.

Most of our respondents were found primarily through Kaggle channels, like our email list, discussion forums and social media channels.

The survey was live from October 22nd to October 29th. We allowed respondents to complete the survey at any time during that window. 
The median response time for those who participated in the survey was 15-20 minutes. 

Not every question was shown to every respondent. You can learn more about the different segments we used in the schema.csv file.

To protect the respondents’ identity, the answers to multiple choice questions have been separated into a separate data file from the 
open-ended responses. We do not provide a key to match up the multiple choice and free form responses. Further, the free form responses have been randomized column-wise such that the responses that appear on the same row did not necessarily come from the same survey-taker.
